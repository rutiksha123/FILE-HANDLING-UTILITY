# DESCRIPTION : 

This is the java program application which is designed to perform file handling operations. Operations such as opening the files , reading the files , writing to the files and also modifying them. I have used the Eclipse IDE to develop this program.
In this Java program application Java Swing, AWT ,IO ,etc. Libraries are used . Here it has a single class FileHandling_opr , which has one constructor. It consists of a GUI (Graphical User Interface) which provides user interaction. The GUI includes a JFrame in which all the components are placed. Components like a JLabel , a disabled JTextField that displays the name of the selected file, A JTextArea in which the contents of the file are displayed, JPanel in which 3 buttons are placed and 3 different buttons each to perform read , write and modify operations. When you click on “Open/Read file” button, a file chooser will pop up from which you can select the file, when you click on “Write to a file” button an input dialog box will pop up , which will ask you to enter the name of the file. If the file will be existing already, then a yes-no dialog box will pop up  to ask you whether you want to overwrite the file or not. If the file is not present the a new file will be created with the text that you have written in the TextArea in the same directory. When you will click on the “Modify file” button, the current file that you have opened will be updated by the text present in  the TextArea. After the contents are written or modified into the file (selected file) then the contents present in the TextArea will be deleted.
The Textarea is placed within the JScrollPane to provide the user a large and scrollable region to work with a large amount of text.The layout used in the Frame is border layout so that every component can be placed properly.The Flow layout is used in JPanel to control the flow of the buttons.
This file handling program implements ActionListener interface. The 3 buttons triggers the events which are handled by the actionPerformed() method of ActionListener. On the click of either of the 3 buttons which task should be performed is handled in the actionPerformed()  method of the ActionListener Interface.This is a platform independent program application, because it is a java program, and it can run on any platform irrespective of whether you are using windows, Linux, Unix ,etc. making it platform independent.This program can be used in practically for reading text files, modifying them or creating a new text files. It helps to perform basic file management task in small environment.
In conclusion, this Java application program code is a simple GUI application that performs basic file handling operations. This java application program can be useful for small-scale file management applications. With additional features and enhancements, the application can be made more robust and useful for a wider range of applications.
